# House-Price-Predictor
House price predictor based on the UK land registry data

Notes:
Use machine learning and tensorflow to predict the price of a house

Use tensorflow (with node/typescript https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to train a model based on the land registry data (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/price-paid-data https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads#single-file) and be able to query the model to get a prediction of a house based on the postcode, property type and date (data available on land registry).
